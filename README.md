# Homework-04
With homework number 4 we were tasked to utilize our knowledge of JavaScript in order to create a webpage that ran a simple quiz app, though it wasn't quite simple at all for me to be honest. The task specifically was to create a quiz with 4 answers per questions where the buttons containing each question changed every time one of the 4 displayed on screen were clicked. We were also tasked with implementing a countdown timer on the side of the web page as well as a link to a seperate page that displayed the player's high scores. I was, however, unsuccesful in creating a timer or a high scores page. To be honest I was barely able to create a functioning quiz at all. This assignment was especially challenging for me because I have been lagging behind in class due to a missed assignment so I truly tried to just complete the main task at hand. The technologies utilized were JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. HTML was utilized to create the layout and buttons for the webpage while css of course was used for styling. The JS took care of all the functuionality of the page as there was considerable use of onclick events and loops/arrays being utilized to make the page properly cycle through questions upon being clicked on.
